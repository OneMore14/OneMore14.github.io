When a process needs to invoke a kernel service, it invokes a system call, one of the calls in
the operating system’s interface. The system call enters the kernel; the kernel performs the service
and returns. Thus a process alternates between executing in user space and kernel space.

内核使用CPU的硬件保护机制确保用户进程只能访问访问用户自己的内存(页表机制)。内核运行时会有更高的硬件权限，当用户程序发起系统调用时，硬件会提升特权等级并开始执行内核中预先定义好的函数

shell只是容易被替换的普通程序

## 1.1 Processes and memory

An xv6 process consists of user-space memory (instructions, data, and stack) and per-process state private to the kernel.

fork和exec分为两个不同的系统调用，可以方便I/O重定向



## 1.2 I/O and File descriptors

The file descriptor interface abstracts away the differences between files, pipes, and devices, making them all look like streams of bytes.

Two file descriptors share an offset if they were derived from the same original file descriptor by a sequence of fork and dup calls. Otherwise file descriptors do not share offsets, even if they resulted from open calls for the same file.

The 2>&1 tells the shell to give the command a file descriptor 2 that is a duplicate of descriptor 1.



## 1.3 Pipes

A pipe is a small kernel buffer exposed to processes as a pair of file descriptors, one for reading and one for writing. 

If no data is available, a read on a pipe waits for either data to be written or for all file descriptors referring to the write end to be closed



## 1.4 File system
